### The challenge

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

### What I learned

This was probably my first multi-page site, one in which I did my own research, wrote a lot of code myself with minimal help.
I learned the importance of a good CSS template was key from the start.  

### Continued development

I would like to focus more on the interactivity and responsiveness of future projects, working with more dynamic data over static data.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank Kevin Powell, his tutorials really helped me out on this project, along with his other CSS videos.
